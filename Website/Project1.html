												<p> Burn the Mob focuses on the story of a witch who has been bound at the stake by an angry mob. In a 
													surprising twist, the player gets to play as the witch. The player must use the spells the witch has 
													and place them strategically to re-direct the torch that the mob threw.

													We started the project by having each team member think of an idea. While everyone was doing that, I spent 
													time setting up the onedrive we'd be working with as well as the trello bord we'd use for task division and 
													planning. Within the onedrive I made a SCRUM file (template) we could work with as well as an excell sheet 
													we could log our hours in. I also made sure we had an easy oversight in the onedrive of the requirements of 
													the project. This way, when we were done brainstorming together and had come up with a game idea, we could 
													immediately start working in an organized way.

												<p>
												When we were done brainstorming, which was done with everyone together writing on a whiteboard and listing all 
												pros and cons of each idea and how well it fit the results from target audience research we had also done,
												we had come up with the game concept of Burn the Mob. By brainstorming in this specific manner, I was able to 
												set up a complete asset list in a short time as well as divide across the previously made trello bords.

												After everything was divided, people got to work. My tasks now were mainly level design and supporting where needed.
												Giving feedback on other's work, documenting what needed to be done and building the website we had to make as a part
												of the project. I focused on making sure that what we needed would be there in the end as well as making sure the product
												kept in line with what we needed to match the target audience's wants and needs.
