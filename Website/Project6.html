												<p> I started the whole process by first diving into how to interview a (potential) client so that the final
													web result would fit their wants and needs as much as possible. Once I had a good overview of which questions 
													I wanted to ask, I interviewed the client together with a fellow student (who did a lot of the UI). I wrote down 
													the answers detailed so they would be easy to work from. The image to the left here shows a good amount of the questions
													that we asked. Each question was based on research so we would get all the most important information from the interview.

													<p> After the interview, my fellow student already went to work to create a few variations of what the website could look like
														in Figma. I started by doing deep research into what goes into web development and making a long list of potential technological
														and creative possibilities for the website. The client wanted a newsletter and contact form that were easy to use and worked,
														so I coded the possibilities I found for them to see if they would work and be simple to use. I found a way for both things
														that fit those criteria.

												<div class="col-6 col-12-narrower">
													<section>
													<p> I then gave the list of possibilities to my fellow student who was working on the UI. Together, we then developed multiple iterations
														of the website. After the first round of development, I made a detailed question list for the testing and sat down with the client to
														discuss the options. During testing I made general notes, which I developed in detail after the interview.
														Together with my fellow student, I would then work on mixing and changing variations based on the feedback.
														We did 3 rounds of testing before the client made the call that the version we presented them with, was exactly
														what they wanted and what should be developed. Because of the development based on research on what was possible,
														development will be easier.
